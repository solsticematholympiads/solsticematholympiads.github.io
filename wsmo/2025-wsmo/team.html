          Hi, I'm Piero! I am a homeschooled high school senior from Southern California and am one of the problem writers for SMO. I am a four-time AIME qualifier and have loved problem writing for almost as long as I have participated in math competitions. In my spare time, I enjoy reading fantasy novels, playing pickleball, and problem writing.
