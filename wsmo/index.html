    The inaugural Winter Solstice Math Olympiads (WSMO) was held virtually on December 21, 2021 - the winter solstice. Initially launched by a small team of middle school students, WSMO 2021 marked the very beginning of our competition series, designed to inspire creative problem solving across all levels of experience.<br><br>
    Dozens of students from across the country participated in our first-ever contest. Prizes were awarded to top individuals and teams, generously supported by our sponsors.
